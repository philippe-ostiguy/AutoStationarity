# AutoStationarity 📈 <br>


## Want to Decrease Your Model’s Prediction Errors by 20%? Follow This Simple Trick

Time series modeling can be tricky, even for experienced data scientists. 
You’ve done everything by the book: used state-of-the-art deep learning models, 
performed feature engineering, normalized your data, and optimized 
hyperparameters. Yet, your model’s performance still falls short. If this is 
your case, this code may help you.

Learn why making your time series stationary improves your model accuracy. Also, 
discover how to automatically apply this technique in your machine learning 
pipeline using a simple Python script.
